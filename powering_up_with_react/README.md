We'll cover some fo the features React offers, including how to: 

-Write React components
-Render data to the page
-Made components communicate
-Handle user events
-Capture user input
-Talk to remote servers

Component-based Architecture
In React, we solve problems by creating components. If a component gets too complex, we break it into smaller, simpler components.

What is a React Component?
A component in React works similarly to JavaScript functions: It generates an output every time it is invoked.

The Virtual DOM Explained
The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of real DOM elements generated by React components before any changes are made to the page.

The Virtual DOM in Action
Virtual DOM diffing allows React to minimize changes to the DOM as a result of user actions - therefore, increasing browser performance.

Writing Our First React Component
Components in React are JavaScript classes that inherit from the React.Component base class.

Rendering Our First React Component
We use ReactDOM to render components to our HTML page as it reads output from a supplied React component and adds it to the DOM

No Quotes Around Markup
The markup we use when writing React apps is not a string. This markup is called JSX (JavaScript XML)
